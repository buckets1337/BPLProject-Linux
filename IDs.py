#IDs.py
#lists information about each player to be loaded into the game.

#each entry for a player should be a list, with attributes in this order:
#1. player name
#2. avatar image filename
#3. pixelArray to use, instead of an image.

#NOTE: THIS WILL CHANGE ONCE PIXEL ARRAYS ARE USED FOR PLAYER IMAGES
